#### :books: A Writing and Organization Toolkit for the 21st Century Author

## Introduction

Borges is an application intended to streamline the creation process for writers. Everything from storyboarding, brainstorming, document organization, automated manuscript generation, and more are intended features for the tool.

There are other tools in the market that attempt to do the same, but all are meant for desktop environments and only have paid subscription modules. They're also very antiquated (in both functionality and design) and offer no real solutions for the modern author. 

Thus, Borges was developed to provide an open-source, web-based alternative to these legacy programs.
